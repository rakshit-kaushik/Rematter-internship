# Company Deduplication System - Complete Summary

## Overview

Your company deduplication system is a sophisticated ensemble-based approach that combines geographic clustering with multiple name similarity methods to identify and group duplicate companies. The system is designed to be both accurate and efficient, with interactive approval for uncertain matches.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **LocationClusterer**: Handles geographic clustering using Haversine distance
2. **NameSimilarityCalculator**: Implements three similarity methods
3. **EnsembleClusterer**: Combines similarity methods with ensemble logic
4. **InteractiveApprover**: Manages manual review of low-confidence clusters
5. **ResultsProcessor**: Handles output generation and analysis
6. **DatabaseManager**: Manages database connections and queries

### Data Flow

```
Database → Location Clustering → Ensemble Name Similarity → Interactive Approval → Results
```

## Detailed Algorithm

### Step 1: Location-Based Clustering

**Purpose**: Group companies by geographic proximity to reduce comparison complexity.

**Process**:
1. **Geographic Blocking**: Companies are grouped by rounded coordinates (4 decimal places)
2. **Distance Calculation**: Haversine formula calculates great circle distances
3. **Threshold Filtering**: Companies within 10 meters are considered co-located

**Key Parameters**:
- Distance threshold: 0.01 km (10 meters)
- Geographic precision: 4 decimal places

### Step 2: Ensemble Name Similarity

**Purpose**: Within each location cluster, compare companies using multiple similarity methods.

**Three Similarity Methods**:

#### 1. Fuzzy Jaccard Similarity
- **Process**: 
  - Extract keywords from company names (remove stop words)
  - Calculate Jaccard similarity on keyword sets
  - Combine with fuzzy string matching
- **Components**:
  - Jaccard similarity (30% weight)
  - Token sort ratio (25% weight)
  - Token set ratio (25% weight)
  - Partial ratio (20% weight)
- **Threshold**: 0.85

#### 2. Jaro-Winkler Similarity
- **Process**:
  - Preprocess names by extracting keywords
  - Apply Jaro-Winkler algorithm for character-level similarity
- **Features**:
  - Accounts for character transpositions
  - Gives higher weight to common prefixes
- **Threshold**: 0.89

#### 3. Metaphone Similarity
- **Process**:
  - Generate phonetic codes using Double Metaphone
  - Compare primary and secondary metaphone codes
  - Use Jaro-Winkler similarity on phonetic representations
- **Weighting**:
  - Primary-Primary: 100% weight
  - Primary-Secondary: 80% weight
  - Secondary-Primary: 80% weight
  - Secondary-Secondary: 60% weight
- **Threshold**: 0.91

### Step 3: Ensemble Logic

**Combination Rule**: Companies are clustered if ANY method exceeds its threshold (very permissive approach)

**Confidence Calculation**:
- Agreement ratio: Number of agreeing methods / total methods
- Weighted score: Average of method scores
- Final confidence: (agreement ratio + weighted score) / 2

### Step 4: Interactive Approval

**Purpose**: Manual review of low-confidence clusters to improve accuracy.

**Process**:
1. Identify clusters with confidence below threshold (0.75)
2. Present cluster details to user
3. Allow approve/reject decision
4. Update cluster assignments based on decisions

## Key Features

### 1. Robust Name Processing
- **Stop Word Removal**: Removes common words like "the", "and", "of", etc.
- **Suffix Normalization**: Standardizes business suffixes (Inc, LLC, Corp, etc.)
- **Keyword Extraction**: Focuses on meaningful identifying words

### 2. Efficient Geographic Clustering
- **Blocking Strategy**: Reduces comparison complexity from O(n²) to O(n) within blocks
- **Precision Control**: Adjustable geographic precision for accuracy vs. performance trade-off
- **Distance Calculation**: Accurate Haversine formula for great circle distances

### 3. Ensemble Approach
- **Multiple Methods**: Combines different similarity algorithms for robustness
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Individual thresholds for each method
- **Confidence Scoring**: Quantitative measure of clustering confidence

### 4. Interactive Quality Control
- **Manual Review**: Human oversight for uncertain matches
- **Flexible Thresholds**: Adjustable confidence threshold for review
- **Detailed Information**: Shows company names, locations, and IDs for informed decisions

### 5. Comprehensive Output
- **Multiple Formats**: CSV files for both clustered and canonical companies
- **Detailed Analysis**: Statistics, confidence distributions, and cluster details
- **Organized Structure**: Separate folders for different output types

## Configuration Options

### Similarity Thresholds
```python
thresholds = {
    'fuzzy_jaccard': 0.85,  # Very permissive
    'jaro_winkler': 0.89,   # Moderate
    'metaphone': 0.91       # Conservative
}
```

### Geographic Parameters
```python
distance_threshold = 0.01  # 10 meters
geographic_precision = 4   # Decimal places for blocking
```

### Interactive Review
```python
confidence_threshold = 0.75  # Clusters below this need review
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Computational Complexity
- **Location Clustering**: O(n log n) due to geographic blocking
- **Name Similarity**: O(k²) where k is average cluster size
- **Overall**: O(n log n + k²) where k << n

### Memory Usage
- **Efficient**: Processes data in chunks
- **Scalable**: Geographic blocking reduces memory requirements
- **Optimized**: Uses NetworkX for graph operations

### Accuracy vs. Speed Trade-offs
- **High Precision**: Multiple similarity methods reduce false positives
- **High Recall**: Permissive ensemble logic catches more matches
- **Balanced**: Interactive review provides quality control

## Output Structure

### Files Generated
1. **Clustered Companies**: `ensemble_location_clustered.csv`
   - All companies with cluster assignments
   - Confidence scores for each company
   - Original and cleaned names
